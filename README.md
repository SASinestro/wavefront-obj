[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SASinestro/wavefront-obj.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SASinestro/wavefront-obj) [![Hackage Version](http://img.shields.io/hackage/v/wavefront-obj.svg)](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/wavefront-obj)

A Wavefront .obj file loading microlibrary for Haskell. Designed for ease of use first, speed second, and robustness last. For use in something like a game engine where you can control the models that you are loading, not something like a model viewer that has to deal with arbitrary data.
